# Arduino_Yogurt_Oven
Simple Arduino project to control the temperature in an enclosure in which yogurt can ferment.

Materials: 
1) Arduino UNO
2) DS1820 temperature sensor
4) Opto 22 Model 240D25 solid state relay
5) Cardboard Box approximately 18"L x 18"W x 8"D
6) Ceramic light ceiling mount
7) 60 watt incandescent bulb
8) 1/2" pink styrofoam insulation
9) Electrical cord 
10) Breadboard (optional)

Code:
Code is borrowed and modified from the examples in the Time library and the DallasTemperature library.

The project was taken on as a way to familiarize oneself with the two libraries, and to be able to walk
from the yogurt while being confident that temperature would be maintained for the length of the ferment
cycle, and subsequently the heat turned off at the appropriate time.  It is rough code, but tested to work.

!!!!
Note!!!! that this project makes use of 120VAC, and should not be attempted if one is not familiar with the
safe handling of household power!!!
